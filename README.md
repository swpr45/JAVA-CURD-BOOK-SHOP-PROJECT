# JAVA-CURD-BOOK-SHOP-PROJECT
This project is a simple Java book shop application that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and the XAMPP server with MySQL as the backend database.
The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can add new books to the database, view the existing books, update the details of a book, and delete books from the inventory. It leverages the power of JDBC to establish a connection with the MySQL database and execute SQL queries for performing these operations.

**Key Features:
**
1. Create: Users can add new books to the inventory by providing relevant details such as the book title, author, publication, and price. The application will validate the input and insert the new book into the MySQL database.
2. Read: The application allows users to view the list of books available in the inventory. Users can browse through the books and see details like the title, author, publication, and price.
3. Update: Users have the ability to update the information of existing books. They can select a book from the inventory, modify any of its attributes, and save the changes to the database.
4. Delete: Users can remove books from the inventory. By selecting a book from the list, they can delete it from the database, ensuring the inventory remains up to date.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Java:** The project is implemented in the Java programming language.
* **JDBC:** It utilizes the JDBC API to connect to the MySQL database and execute SQL queries.
* **XAMPP Server:** XAMPP is used as a local server to host the MySQL database and provide a      development environment.
